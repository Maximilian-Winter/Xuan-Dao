When the Dao is lost, there arises virtue. When virtue is lost, there arises humanity. When humanity is lost, there arises righteousness. When righteousness is lost, there arises ritual propriety.

The Dao never does anything,
Yet through it all things are done.

If powerful men and women
Could center themselves in it,
The whole world would be transformed
By itself, in its natural rhythms.

People would be content
With their simple, everyday lives,
In harmony, and free of desire.

When there is no desire,
All things are at peace.

A man is born gentle and weak.
At his death he is hard and stiff.
Green plants are tender and filled with sap.
At their death they are withered and dry.
Therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death.
The gentle and yielding is the disciple of life.
Thus an army without flexibility never wins a battle.
A tree that is unbending is easily broken.
The hard and strong will fall.
The soft and weak will overcome.

In the pursuit of learning, every day something is acquired.
In the pursuit of Dao, every day something is dropped.
Less and less is done
Until non-action is achieved.
When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.

The world is ruled by letting things take their course.
It cannot be ruled by interfering.

The best leaders, the people barely know they exist.
The next best, the people honor and praise.
The next, the people fear.
And the next, the people hate.

When the best leader's work is done,
The people say, 'We did it ourselves!'
